# Implementation of PI2 AQM in ns-3

You can find the Implementation for AQM PI2 [1] In ns-3 in this repository. PI2 with itâ€™s simple design is less expensive in computation and achieves no worse or in some cases better responsiveness and stability in comparison to PIE [2]. bbbbb

# Reproduce simulation results as presented in paper

Prerequisites       
1. ns-3.26 or higher. It is necessary that the ns-3 version you use has PIE Queue Disc available. PIE has been made available since 3.26 release.#
